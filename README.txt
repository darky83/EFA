E.F.A (Email Filter Appliance) build 0.3

http://www.efa-project.org/

E.F.A stands for Email Filter Appliance
E.F.A is born out of a need for a cost-effective email virus & spam scanning solution after the ESVA project died.

We try to create a complete package using existing open-source anti-spam projects and combine them to a single easy to use (virtual) appliance.
